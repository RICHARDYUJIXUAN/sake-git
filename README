Sake-Git
========

Here are a few Sake tasks to make developing with Git easier (and some corresponding Git aliases to 
make invoking them easier). Install them with:

$ rake install

Or, if you don't want to actually download this stuff, just use Sake:

$ sake -i "http://github.com/eventualbuddha/sake-git/tree/master/git.rake?raw=true"




Common Commands
---------------

$ sake git:update

Updates your current git repository, autodetecting whether you have a regular ol' git project or a
git-svn project. Alias it to `git up' with this alias:

[alias]
  up = !sake git:update




$ sake git:push

Commits any changes in your current branch not yet pushed upstream AND ports 'em over to master.
Another alias for ya:

[alias]
  ci = !sake git:push




$ sake git:open [NAME=mynewbranch]

Creates a new branch off master. Think of this as opening an issue, or a new path of development.
Because of the way Rake handles (or _doesn't_ handle) arguments, the alias for this one is a little
weird:

[alias]
  open = !sake git:open NAME= -- $1

Allowing you to call it like so:

$ git open mynewbranch

You can even call it without the branch name and it'll ask you for it:

$ git open
* Name your branch: mynewbranch




$ sake git:close [NAME=mynewbranch]

This is open's brother, and should be used when you finish something and have already moved it to
master or upstream. If you haven't yet, don't worry - this won't eat your data. Aliases for
everyone:

[alias]
  close = !sake git:close NAME= -- $1

Thanks to Coda Hale and everyone else at Wesabe for trying these out when I first wrote them and
contributing tasks of their own, and to the Rubinius folks for giving me the idea in the first place.
